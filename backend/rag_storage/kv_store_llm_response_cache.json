This prohibition shall include a prohibition against any subletting or assignment by operation of law. If this Lease is assigned or the Premises or any part sublet or occupied by anybody other than Tenant, Landlord may collect rent from the assignee， subtenant or occupant and apply the same to the rent herein reserved, but no such assignment, subletting， occupancy or collection of rent shall be deemed a waiver of any restrictive covenant contained in this Section 13.1 or the \n\nacceptance of the assignee， subtenant or occupant as tenant，or a release of Tenant from the performance by Tenant of any covenants on the part of Tenant herein contained.

expense, and sell such property if necessary to satisfy any deficiency in payments by Tenant as required hereunder， all without notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming 1iable for any loss or damage occasioned thereby. \n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if Tenant commits any default hereunder for or precedent to which or with respect to which notice is herein required, and commits such defaults within 12 months thereafter， no notice shall thereafter be required to be given by Landlord as to or precedent to any such subsequent default during such 12 month period (as Tenant hereby waiving the same) before exercising any or all remedies available to Landlord. \n\nSection 18.2. Right to Relet. \n\nIf Landlord re-enters the Premises as above provided，or if it takes possession pursuant to legal proceedings or otherwise， it may either terminate this Lease or it may， from time to time，without terminating this Lease， make such alterations and repairs as it deems advisable to relet the Premises，and relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may extend beyond the Lease Term) and at such rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion deems advisable; upon each such reletting all rentals received by Landlord therefrom shall be applied, first， to any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second, to pay any costs and expenses of reletting， including brokers and attorneys' fees and costs of alterations and repairs; third， to rent due hereunder，and the residue，if any， shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as it becomes due \n\nhereunder，with a credit thereon to the extent that the aggregate rentals and other charges shall exceed the respective amount due hereunder， provided that such credit shall only be used to reduce any further rent owed by Tenant pursuant to this Section and under no circumstances shall Landlord be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any excess rental received. \n\nIf rentals received from such reletting during any month are less than that to be paid during that month by Tenant hereunder， Tenant shall immediately pay any such deficiency to Landlord. No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such termination is given by Landlord. \n\nNotwithstanding any such reletting without termination， Landlord may at any time thereafter terminate this Lease for any prior breach or default. If Landliord terminates this Lease for any breach， or otherwise takes any action on account of Tenant's breach or default hereunder,in addition to any other remedies it may have， it may recover from Tenant all damages incurred by reason of such breach or default, including attorneys' fees，all costs of retaking the Premises and including the excess， if any，of the total rent and charges reserved in this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term over the then reasonable rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the Lease Term， all of which shall be immediately due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. In determining the rent payable by Tenant hereunder subsequent to default, the Minimum Annual Rent for each year of the unexpired portion of the Lease Term shall equal the average Minimum Annual and Percentage Rents which Tenant was obligated to pay from the commencement of the Lease Term to the time of default，or during the preceding 3 full calendar years，whichever period is shorter. \n\nSection 18.3. Counterclaim. \n\nIf Landlord commences any proceedings for non-payment of rent (Minimum Annual Rent， Percentage Rent or additional rent)， Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim of any nature or description in such proceedings. This shall not，however，be construed as a waiver of Tenant's right to assert such claims in a separate action brought by Tenant. The covenants to pay rent and other amounts hereunder are independent covenants and Tenant shall have no right to hold back, offset or fail to pay any such amounts for default by Landlord or any other reason whatsoever. \n\nSection 18.4. Waiver of Rights of Redemption. \n\nTo the extent permitted by law, Tenant waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws if Tenant is evicted or dispossessed for any cause， or if Landlord obtains \n\npossession of the Premises due to Tenant's default hereunder or otherwise. \n\nSection 19.1. Default Defined， Notice. \n\nLandlord shall in no event be charged with default in any of its obligations hereunder unless and until Landlord shall have failed to perform such obligations within 30 days (or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default） after written notice to Landlord by Tenant， specifically describing such failure. \n\nSection 19.2. Notice to First Mortgagee. \n\nIf the holder of the first mortgage covering the Premises shall have given written notice to Tenant of the address to which notices to such holder are to be sent， Tenant shall give such holder written notice simultaneously with any notice given to Landlord of any default of Landlord,and if Landlord fails to cure any default asserted in said notice within the time provided above， Tenant shall notify such holder in writing of the failure to cure, and said holder shall have the right but not the obligation， within 30 days\n```",

Amount of Deposit. None. Intentionally deleted. \n\nARTICLE XVI DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION \n\nIf the improvements on the Premises are hereafter damaged or destroyed or rendered partially untenantable for their accustomed use by fire or other casualty Tenant shall promptly repair the same to substantially the condition which they were in immediately prior to the happening of such casualty (including stock in trade, fixtures, furniture, furnishings，carpeting， floor covering， wall covering, drapes and equipment)， and from the date of such casualty until the Premises are so repaired and restored, the Minimum Monthly Rent payments payable hereunder shall abate in such proportion as the part of said Premises thus destroyed or rendered untenantable bears to the total Premises: provided， however， that if the improvements on the Premises be damaged， destroyed or rendered untenantable for their accustomed uses by fire or other casualty to the extent of more than 50% of the cost to replace the same during the last 3 years of the Lease Term， then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease effective as of the date of such casualty by giving to Landlord, within 30 days after the happening of such casualty， written notice of such termination. If such notice be given， this Lease shall terminate and Tenant shall promptly pay or assign to Landiord any and all insurance proceeds recoverable by Tenant as a result of such casualty. Unless Tenant elects to terminate this Lease as provided above, Tenant will either commence and diligently pursue restoration of the improvements on the Premises or raze and remove what remains of such improvements within 9O days following the date of any casualty. \n\nSection 17.1. Condemnation and Damages. \n\nIn the event any or all of the Premises is taken by eminent domain，or sale in lieu thereof，Landlord and Tenant shall each retain their respective right to seek damages from the condemning authority for loss in the fair market value of the Premises and the improvements thereon， respectively， and shall cooperate in any legal proceeding required to recover such damages. \n\nSection 17.2. Termination. \n\nIf all of the Premises is taken by eminent domain, or sale in lieu hereof， this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such taking and any prepaid rents shall be refunded by Landlord. \n\nSection 17.3. Substitution and Restoration. \n\nIf a portion of the Premises material to the continued and successful operation of the Tenant's store (as determined by Tenant） is taken by eminent domain, or sale in 1ieu thereof, Landlord may substitute other contiguous land if the same shall then be available. If such other land is not substituted, Tenant shall, within 3O days after it receives notice of such taking by eminent domain, either terminate this Lease or， for the remainder of the Lease Term， pay that portion of the Minimum Annual Rent herein reserved which has the same relationship to the entire Minimum Annual Rent payable hereunder as the value of the part of the Premises remaining after taking by eminent domain bears to the value of the Premises immediately prior to the date of taking by eminent domain. In the event Tenant elects to terminate this Lease， rentals shall be apportioned as of the date of taking. Should Tenant elect not to terminate this Lease， Tenant shall repair, restore or rebuild Tenant's improvements as nearly as possible to the condition they were in just prior to the taking. If the portion of the Premises or improvements thereon taken by eminent domain is not material to the continued operation of Tenant's business， then no adjustment in rent shall be made and this Lease shall continue. \n\nSection 18.1. Right to Re-Enter. \n\nThe following shall be considered for all purposes to be defaults under and breaches of this Lease: (a) any failure of Tenant to pay any rent or other amount when due hereunder after 15 days written notice; (b) any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other of the terms, provisions， conditions and covenants of this Lease for more than 30 days after written notice of such failure; (c) a determination by Landlord that Tenant has submitted any false report required to be furnished hereunder; (d） anything done by Tenant upon or in connection with the Premises or the construction of any part thereof which after 30 days written notice and failure to cure within said 3O days, \n\ndirectly or indirectly interferes in any way with, or results in a work stoppage in connection with， construction of any part of the center or any other tenant's space: (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Tenant or the filing by or against Tenant within 3O days of a petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of Tenant's property， or Tenant's assignment for the benefit of creditors; (f) if Tenant abandons or vacates or does not do business in the Premises for 10 days,or (g) this Lease or Tenant's interest herein or in the Premises or any improvements thereon or any property of Tenant are executed upon or attached after 15 days notice thereof; or (h) the Premises come into the hands of any person other than expressly permitted under this Lease. In any such event， and without grace period, demand or notice (the same being hereby waived by Tenant)， Landlord, in addition to all other rights or remedies it may have, shall have the right thereupon or at any time thereafter to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant stating the date upon which such termination shall be effective, and shall have the right,either before or after any such termination, to re-enter and take possession of the Premises， remove all persons and property from the Premises， store such property at Tenant's expense, and sell\n```",

trespass or becoming 1iable for any loss or damage occasioned thereby. \n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if Tenant commits any default hereunder for or precedent to which or with respect to which notice is herein required, and commits such defaults within 12 months thereafter， no notice shall thereafter be required to be given by Landlord as to or precedent to any such subsequent default during such 12 month period (as Tenant hereby waiving the same) before exercising any or all remedies available to Landlord. \n\nSection 18.2. Right to Relet. \n\nIf Landlord re-enters the Premises as above provided，or if it takes possession pursuant to legal proceedings or otherwise， it may either terminate this Lease or it may， from time to time，without terminating this Lease， make such alterations and repairs as it deems advisable to relet the Premises，and relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may extend beyond the Lease Term) and at such rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion deems advisable; upon each such reletting all rentals received by Landlord therefrom shall be applied, first， to any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second, to pay any costs and expenses of reletting， including brokers and attorneys' fees and costs of alterations and repairs; third， to rent due hereunder，and the residue，if any， shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as it becomes due \n\nhereunder，with a credit thereon to the extent that the aggregate rentals and other charges shall exceed the respective amount due hereunder， provided that such credit shall only be used to reduce any further rent owed by Tenant pursuant to this Section and under no circumstances shall Landlord be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any excess rental received. \n\nIf rentals received from such reletting during any month are less than that to be paid during that month by Tenant hereunder， Tenant shall immediately pay any such deficiency to Landlord. No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such termination is given by Landlord. \n\nNotwithstanding any such reletting without termination， Landlord may at any time thereafter terminate this Lease for any prior breach or default. If Landliord terminates this Lease for any breach， or otherwise takes any action on account of Tenant's breach or default hereunder,in addition to any other remedies it may have， it may recover from Tenant all damages incurred by reason of such breach or default, including attorneys' fees，all costs of retaking the Premises and including the excess， if any，of the total rent and charges reserved in this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term over the then reasonable rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the Lease Term， all of which shall be immediately due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. In determining the rent payable by Tenant hereunder subsequent to default, the Minimum Annual Rent for each year of the unexpired portion of the Lease Term shall equal the average Minimum Annual and Percentage Rents which Tenant was obligated to pay from the commencement of the Lease Term to the time of default，or during the preceding 3 full calendar years，whichever period is shorter. \n\nSection 18.3. Counterclaim. \n\nIf Landlord commences any proceedings for non-payment of rent (Minimum Annual Rent， Percentage Rent or additional rent)， Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim of any nature or description in such proceedings. This shall not，however，be construed as a waiver of Tenant's right to assert such claims in a separate action brought by Tenant. The covenants to pay rent and other amounts hereunder are independent covenants and Tenant shall have no right to hold back, offset or fail to pay any such amounts for default by Landlord or any other reason whatsoever. \n\nSection 18.4.

If such notice be given， this Lease shall terminate and Tenant shall promptly pay or assign to Landiord any and all insurance proceeds recoverable by Tenant as a result of such casualty. Unless Tenant elects to terminate this Lease as provided above, Tenant will either commence and diligently pursue restoration of the improvements on the Premises or raze and remove what remains of such improvements within 9O days following the date of any casualty. \n\nSection 17.1. Condemnation and Damages. \n\nIn the event any or all of the Premises is taken by eminent domain，or sale in lieu thereof，Landlord and Tenant shall each retain their respective right to seek damages from the condemning authority for loss in the fair market value of the Premises and the improvements thereon， respectively， and shall cooperate in any legal proceeding required to recover such damages. \n\nSection 17.2. Termination. \n\nIf all of the Premises is taken by eminent domain, or sale in lieu hereof， this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such taking and any prepaid rents shall be refunded by Landlord. \n\nSection 17.3. Substitution and Restoration. \n\nIf a portion of the Premises material to the continued and successful operation of the Tenant's store (as determined by Tenant） is taken by eminent domain, or sale in 1ieu thereof, Landlord may substitute other contiguous land if the same shall then be available. If such other land is not substituted, Tenant shall, within 3O days after it receives notice of such taking by eminent domain, either terminate this Lease or， for the remainder of the Lease Term， pay that portion of the Minimum Annual Rent herein reserved which has the same relationship to the entire Minimum Annual Rent payable hereunder as the value of the part of the Premises remaining after taking by eminent domain bears to the value of the Premises immediately prior to the date of taking by eminent domain. In the event Tenant elects to terminate this Lease， rentals shall be apportioned as of the date of taking. Should Tenant elect not to terminate this Lease， Tenant shall repair, restore or rebuild Tenant's improvements as nearly as possible to the condition they were in just prior to the taking. If the portion of the Premises or improvements thereon taken by eminent domain is not material to the continued operation of Tenant's business， then no adjustment in rent shall be made and this Lease shall continue. \n\nSection 18.1. Right to Re-Enter. \n\nThe following shall be considered for all purposes to be defaults under and breaches of this Lease: (a) any failure of Tenant to pay any rent or other amount when due hereunder after 15 days written notice; (b) any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other of the terms, provisions， conditions and covenants of this Lease for more than 30 days after written notice of such failure; (c) a determination by Landlord that Tenant has submitted any false report required to be furnished hereunder; (d） anything done by Tenant upon or in connection with the Premises or the construction of any part thereof which after 30 days written notice and failure to cure within said 3O days, \n\ndirectly or indirectly interferes in any way with, or results in a work stoppage in connection with， construction of any part of the center or any other tenant's space: (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Tenant or the filing by or against Tenant within 3O days of a petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of Tenant's property， or Tenant's assignment for the benefit of creditors; (f) if Tenant abandons or vacates or does not do business in the Premises for 10 days,or (g) this Lease or Tenant's interest herein or in the Premises or any improvements thereon or any property of Tenant are executed upon or attached after 15 days notice thereof; or (h) the Premises come into the hands of any person other than expressly permitted under this Lease. In any such event， and without grace period, demand or notice (the same being hereby waived by Tenant)， Landlord, in addition to all other rights or remedies it may have, shall have the right thereupon or at any time thereafter to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant stating the date upon which such termination shall be effective, and shall have the right,either before or after any such termination, to re-enter and take possession of the Premises， remove all persons and property from the Premises， store such property at Tenant's expense, and sell\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Its structural placement suggests it is meant to precede a formal legal text, serving as a clear identifier for what follows. However, the actual details of the amendment were not included in the discarded content. The context indicates that various sections of a lease were being amended, such as extending the lease term and addressing indemnity concerning brokers. Its discarding may have occurred because it lacked substantive details necessary for legal clarity. The amendment's context is deeply tied to the lease's continuity and modifications between Landlord and Tenant, thus playing a significant role in ensuring the lease remains enforceable and reflecting any agreed changes. This heading connects to the broader discussion of the lease agreement, emphasizing its formal nature and previous terms while elucidating the changes agreed upon.\n```",

It is organized into three columns: 'Term', 'Annual Rent', and 'Monthly Rent'. The 'Term' column outlines the options for lease extension while the other two columns detail the corresponding rent amounts for these terms. Key points include the specifications of the lease extensions, with Option 1 having an annual rent of $101,640.00 and monthly rent of $8,470.00 for the period from February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021. Following this, Option 2 reflects an increase to $111,804.00 annually and $9,317.00 monthly from February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2026. This suggests a rent escalation strategy over time. Statistically, this indicates a projected total rent increase of approximately 11.4% over the five years. The increase in both annual and monthly rent corresponds with the trends in the region's real estate market, ensuring lease terms remain competitive and reflective of current market value. The data presented supports the surrounding content by illustrating the financial implications and expectations set in the First Amendment to Lease, specifically highlighting landlord and tenant agreements on rent adjustments and obligations.\n```",

(Tenant). It has three columns: 'Term,' which details the specific time frames for rent payments; 'Annual Rent,' showing the total annual rent due for each term; and 'Monthly Rent,' providing a breakdown of the annual rent into monthly payments. Key data points include the transition from an annual rent of $84,000.00 for the first term (2/1/06-1/31/11) to $92,400.00 for the second term (2/1/11-1/31/16), indicating a rent increase of 10.71%, reflecting adjustments for inflation or property value increases over the five-year extension. The significance of identifying these financial terms in relation to the surrounding document lies in the legal context of the lease agreement where both parties outline their rights and obligations, ensuring clarity in financial expectations. The table effectively illustrates the financial ramifications of the lease amendment, thereby supporting the legal framework established in the lease discussions.\n```",

(Tenant). It has three columns: 'Term,' which details the specific time frames for rent payments; 'Annual Rent,' showing the total annual rent due for each term; and 'Monthly Rent,' providing a breakdown of the annual rent into monthly payments. Key data points include the transition from an annual rent of $84,000.00 for the first term (2/1/06-1/31/11) to $92,400.00 for the second term (2/1/11-1/31/16), indicating a rent increase of 10.71%, reflecting adjustments for inflation or property value increases over the five-year extension. The significance of identifying these financial terms in relation to the surrounding document lies in the legal context of the lease agreement where both parties outline their rights and obligations, ensuring clarity in financial expectations. The table effectively illustrates the financial ramifications of the lease amendment, thereby supporting the legal framework established in the lease discussions.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It is organized into three columns: 'Term', 'Annual Rent', and 'Monthly Rent'. The 'Term' column outlines the options for lease extension while the other two columns detail the corresponding rent amounts for these terms. Key points include the specifications of the lease extensions, with Option 1 having an annual rent of $101,640.00 and monthly rent of $8,470.00 for the period from February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021. Following this, Option 2 reflects an increase to $111,804.00 annually and $9,317.00 monthly from February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2026. This suggests a rent escalation strategy over time. Statistically, this indicates a projected total rent increase of approximately 11.4% over the five years. The increase in both annual and monthly rent corresponds with the trends in the region's real estate market, ensuring lease terms remain competitive and reflective of current market value. The data presented supports the surrounding content by illustrating the financial implications and expectations set in the First Amendment to Lease, specifically highlighting landlord and tenant agreements on rent adjustments and obligations.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It is organized into two columns: 'Period' and 'Breakpoint'. The 'Period' column delineates distinct time frames during which specific financial thresholds (Breakpoint) apply for rent calculations based on gross sales. The key data points feature breakpoints increasing progressively from $4,600,000 during the initial five-year period (2/1/06-1/31/11) to $5,990,200 in the later period (2/1/21-1/31/26). This pattern indicates escalating revenue expectations as the lease progresses, reflecting potential business growth. The inclusion of options for renewal at adjusted breakpoints relates directly to the lease provisions discussed, indicating a dynamic adjustment aligned with market conditions or expected sales growth. The table thus illustrates how leasing terms can adapt over time based on business performance, reinforcing the need for flexibility in lease agreements as outlined in the surrounding content.\n```",

The section is labeled with 'LANDLORD' in bold capital letters, indicating that this part of the document pertains to the landlord's acknowledgement or signature. Below this label is the name 'TRANSPORTATION PLAZA ASSOCIATES', presumably the name of the landlord entity involved in the agreement. A handwritten signature is present below this name, scribbled in an ornate and somewhat abstract manner. This signature is followed by a horizontal line and the label 'By:', suggesting that the signature belongs to an authorized representative of the landlord. Another horizontal line appears below the signature, labeled 'Date', although the entered date is not legible. The background is plain, likely representing white paper, and the text is in a standard black font, suggesting a formal setting typical of legal documents. This signature section is likely part of a larger lease amendment document between the landlord and a tenant, as indicated by the surrounding context provided in the legal text.\n```",

It is organized into two columns: 'Period' and 'Breakpoint'. The 'Period' column delineates distinct time frames during which specific financial thresholds (Breakpoint) apply for rent calculations based on gross sales. The key data points feature breakpoints increasing progressively from $4,600,000 during the initial five-year period (2/1/06-1/31/11) to $5,990,200 in the later period (2/1/21-1/31/26). This pattern indicates escalating revenue expectations as the lease progresses, reflecting potential business growth. The inclusion of options for renewal at adjusted breakpoints relates directly to the lease provisions discussed, indicating a dynamic adjustment aligned with market conditions or expected sales growth.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It is organized into three columns: 'Term', 'Annual Rent', and 'Monthly Rent'. The 'Term' column specifies the periods over which the rents are applicable, with the first period from February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2011, and the second from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2016. The 'Annual Rent' indicates the yearly payment amount, which shows an increase from $84,000 during the first term to $92,400 in the second period, reflecting a $8,400 increase, or 10% over five years. The 'Monthly Rent' also reflects this increment, rising from $7,000 to $7,700. This increase coincides with prevailing inflationary trends in real estate and reflects the Landlord's ability to adjust the lease terms after the initial five years based on market conditions. Notably, the amendment is directly tied to the broader lease agreement outlined in the surrounding content, emphasizing stability and mutual responsibilities between Landlord and Tenant without the presence of any current defaults or disputes. The structure supports the clear understanding of financial commitments over stated periods, thus providing a transparent basis for both parties involved.\n```",

It is organized into three columns: 'Term,' 'Annual Rent,' and 'Monthly Rent.' The first row contains the headers, while subsequent rows detail two options for lease extensions. Option 1 covers the period from February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021, with an annual rent of $101,640.00 and a monthly rent of $8,470.00. Option 2 spans February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2026, with increased annual rent at $111,804.00 and monthly rent at $9,317.00. A significant insight reveals a rent increase of approximately $10,164.00 (roughly 10%) in the transition from Option 1 to Option 2, indicating a potential consideration for market conditions and inflation. The data illustrates the financial commitments of the Tenant as outlined in the surrounding lease amendment context. This table confirms the adjustments to rent outlined in the First Amendment to Lease, demonstrating the contractual obligations between Tenant and Landlord and underlining the importance of these terms in the lease documentation process.\n```",

It is organized into three columns: 'Term,' 'Annual Rent,' and 'Monthly Rent.' The first row contains the headers, while subsequent rows detail two options for lease extensions. Option 1 covers the period from February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021, with an annual rent of $101,640.00 and a monthly rent of $8,470.00. Option 2 spans February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2026, with increased annual rent at $111,804.00 and monthly rent at $9,317.00. A significant insight reveals a rent increase of approximately $10,164.00 (roughly 10%) in the transition from Option 1 to Option 2, indicating a potential consideration for market conditions and inflation. The data illustrates the financial commitments of the Tenant as outlined in the surrounding lease amendment context. This table confirms the adjustments to rent outlined in the First Amendment to Lease, demonstrating the contractual obligations between Tenant and Landlord and underlining the importance of these terms in the lease documentation process.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

The surrounding context includes detailed amendments to a lease agreement, where clarity in identification of each part of the document is crucial for legal purposes. The absence of this identifier may hinder effective retrieval and reference of the document within legal frameworks, impacting the integrity of record-keeping. Understanding its role helps clarify the comprehensive management of lease agreements by connecting specific references to the legal text, assisting parties in finding pertinent sections quickly.\n```",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

    "return": "The document outlines the importance of **Annual Rent** as a crucial financial term specified in lease agreements. **Annual Rent** indicates the total yearly rental amount that a tenant is obligated to pay, which is vital for understanding both the financial responsibilities of the tenant and the revenue expectations of the landlord. \n\nIn the context provided, it seems that while the concept of Annual Rent is noted, the actual numerical value for the Annual Rent might be missing or not explicitly stated within the document. This lack of specificity can indeed affect the clarity of the financial obligations, suggesting that there may be incomplete details that require further investigation or completion. Ensuring the inclusion of an Annual Rent figure is essential as it is a standard component expected in lease documentation, providing necessary financial clarity.\n\nFor instance, in the First Amendment to a Lease between Transportation Plaza Associates (Landlord) and GMRI, Inc. (Tenant), the **Annual Rent** was defined as $101,640.00 for the period from February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021, which illustrates that having this information is crucial for both parties involved in the lease agreement.\n\nTo summarize, without a confirmed annual rent value, the document's financial assessments could be ambiguous, requiring careful rectification to enhance clarity and enforce obligations as outlined in the Trust Agreement.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] BTC-Olive Garden First Amendment to Lease.pdf\n- [2] BTC-Olive Garden Lease .pdf",

While the specific lease expiration date is not mentioned in the provided context, we can derive that the **Lease Term** is a significant component of the **Lease Agreement** that determines the effective period of the lease.\n\n### Importance of Lease Expiration\n\n- **Clarity and Planning**: The lease expiration date is crucial for both landlords and tenants, enabling them to plan for renewal or termination actions well in advance.\n- **Legal Obligations**: Including a specific expiration date helps ensure that both parties are aware of their obligations and rights under the lease agreement during its term.\n- **Standard Requirement**: It is standard for lease documents to clearly state expiration dates to mitigate confusion and potential disputes regarding the lease's continuation.\n\n### Potential Issues due to Absence of Expiration Date\n\n- **Uncertainty**: Without a clearly defined expiration date, either party may be uncertain about their commitments and responsibilities.\n- **Need for Investigation**: The absence of such a critical detail may warrant further examination of the lease document to ensure it is complete and compliant with standard practices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, including a lease expiration date is a fundamental requirement and reflects the necessity to convey essential lease terms adequately. Although the specific value is missing in this context, it reinforces the need for thoroughness in lease documentation to avoid misinterpretations in the landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] BTC-Olive Garden First Amendment to Lease.pdf\n- [2] BTC-Olive Garden Lease.pdf",

This can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of duties, highlighting the importance of ensuring completeness and clarity within any legal documentation associated with leases.\n\nThe absence of specific values or interpretations of these obligations can indicate a gap in the documentation, which can necessitate further action to fill these voids. Therefore, ensuring that landlord responsibilities are thoroughly detailed is essential for preventing disputes and maintaining a clear understanding of contractual expectations between both parties. \n\n### References\n\n- [1] BTC-Olive Garden First Amendment to Lease.pdf\n- [2] BTC-Olive Garden Lease .pdf",
