This prohibition shall include a prohibition against any subletting or assignment by operation of law. If this Lease is assigned or the Premises or any part sublet or occupied by anybody other than Tenant, Landlord may collect rent from the assignee， subtenant or occupant and apply the same to the rent herein reserved, but no such assignment, subletting， occupancy or collection of rent shall be deemed a waiver of any restrictive covenant contained in this Section 13.1 or the \n\nacceptance of the assignee， subtenant or occupant as tenant，or a release of Tenant from the performance by Tenant of any covenants on the part of Tenant herein contained. Any assignment (a） as to which Landlord has consented; or (b) which is required by reason of a final nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (c） which is made by reason of and in accordance with the provisions of any law or statute， including，without limitation, the Bankruptcy Acts shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this Lease， and shall not be effective or deemed valid unless, at the time of such assignment: \n\n1. each assignee shall assume the obligations of this Lease by executing，acknowledging and delivering to Landlord， before the effective date of such assignment， a written assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; and \n\n2.

If such notice be given， this Lease shall terminate and Tenant shall promptly pay or assign to Landiord any and all insurance proceeds recoverable by Tenant as a result of such casualty. Unless Tenant elects to terminate this Lease as provided above, Tenant will either commence and diligently pursue restoration of the improvements on the Premises or raze and remove what remains of such improvements within 9O days following the date of any casualty. \n\nSection 17.1. Condemnation and Damages. \n\nIn the event any or all of the Premises is taken by eminent domain，or sale in lieu thereof，Landlord and Tenant shall each retain their respective right to seek damages from the condemning authority for loss in the fair market value of the Premises and the improvements thereon， respectively， and shall cooperate in any legal proceeding required to recover such damages. \n\nSection 17.2. Termination. \n\nIf all of the Premises is taken by eminent domain, or sale in lieu hereof， this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such taking and any prepaid rents shall be refunded by Landlord. \n\nSection 17.3. Substitution and Restoration. \n\nIf a portion of the Premises material to the continued and successful operation of the Tenant's store (as determined by Tenant） is taken by eminent domain, or sale in 1ieu thereof, Landlord may substitute other contiguous land if the same shall then be available. If such other land is not substituted, Tenant shall, within 3O days after it receives notice of such taking by eminent domain, either terminate this Lease or， for the remainder of the Lease Term， pay that portion of the Minimum Annual Rent herein reserved which has the same relationship to the entire Minimum Annual Rent payable hereunder as the value of the part of the Premises remaining after taking by eminent domain bears to the value of the Premises immediately prior to the date of taking by eminent domain. In the event Tenant elects to terminate this Lease， rentals shall be apportioned as of the date of taking. Should Tenant elect not to terminate this Lease， Tenant shall repair, restore or rebuild Tenant's improvements as nearly as possible to the condition they were in just prior to the taking. If the portion of the Premises or improvements thereon taken by eminent domain is not material to the continued operation of Tenant's business， then no adjustment in rent shall be made and this Lease shall continue. \n\nSection 18.1. Right to Re-Enter. \n\nThe following shall be considered for all purposes to be defaults under and breaches of this Lease: (a) any failure of Tenant to pay any rent or other amount when due hereunder after 15 days written notice; (b) any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other of the terms, provisions， conditions and covenants of this Lease for more than 30 days after written notice of such failure; (c) a determination by Landlord that Tenant has submitted any false report required to be furnished hereunder; (d） anything done by Tenant upon or in connection with the Premises or the construction of any part thereof which after 30 days written notice and failure to cure within said 3O days, \n\ndirectly or indirectly interferes in any way with, or results in a work stoppage in connection with， construction of any part of the center or any other tenant's space: (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Tenant or the filing by or against Tenant within 3O days of a petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of Tenant's property， or Tenant's assignment for the benefit of creditors; (f) if Tenant abandons or vacates or does not do business in the Premises for 10 days,or (g) this Lease or Tenant's interest herein or in the Premises or any improvements thereon or any property of Tenant are executed upon or attached after 15 days notice thereof; or (h) the Premises come into the hands of any person other than expressly permitted under this Lease.

Right to Relet. \n\nIf Landlord re-enters the Premises as above provided，or if it takes possession pursuant to legal proceedings or otherwise， it may either terminate this Lease or it may， from time to time，without terminating this Lease， make such alterations and repairs as it deems advisable to relet the Premises，and relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may extend beyond the Lease Term) and at such rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion deems advisable; upon each such reletting all rentals received by Landlord therefrom shall be applied, first， to any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second, to pay any costs and expenses of reletting， including brokers and attorneys' fees and costs of alterations and repairs; third， to rent due hereunder，and the residue，if any， shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as it becomes due \n\nhereunder，with a credit thereon to the extent that the aggregate rentals and other charges shall exceed the respective amount due hereunder， provided that such credit shall only be used to reduce any further rent owed by Tenant pursuant to this Section and under no circumstances shall Landlord be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any excess rental received. \n\nIf rentals received from such reletting during any month are less than that to be paid during that month by Tenant hereunder， Tenant shall immediately pay any such deficiency to Landlord. No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such termination is given by Landlord. \n\nNotwithstanding any such reletting without termination， Landlord may at any time thereafter terminate this Lease for any prior breach or default. If Landliord terminates this Lease for any breach， or otherwise takes any action on account of Tenant's breach or default hereunder,in addition to any other remedies it may have， it may recover from Tenant all damages incurred by reason of such breach or default, including attorneys' fees，all costs of retaking the Premises and including the excess， if any，of the total rent and charges reserved in this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term over the then reasonable rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the Lease Term， all of which shall be immediately due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. In determining the rent payable by Tenant hereunder subsequent to default, the Minimum Annual Rent for each year of the unexpired portion of the Lease Term shall equal the average Minimum Annual and Percentage Rents which Tenant was obligated to pay from the commencement of the Lease Term to the time of default，or during the preceding 3 full calendar years，whichever period is shorter. \n\nSection 18.3. Counterclaim. \n\nIf Landlord commences any proceedings for non-payment of rent (Minimum Annual Rent， Percentage Rent or additional rent)， Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim of any nature or description in such proceedings. This shall not，however，be construed as a waiver of Tenant's right to assert such claims in a separate action brought by Tenant. The covenants to pay rent and other amounts hereunder are independent covenants and Tenant shall have no right to hold back, offset or fail to pay any such amounts for default by Landlord or any other reason whatsoever. \n\nSection 18.4. Waiver of Rights of Redemption. \n\nTo the extent permitted by law, Tenant waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws if Tenant is evicted or dispossessed for any cause， or if Landlord obtains \n\npossession of the Premises due to Tenant's default hereunder or otherwise. \n\nSection 19.1. Default Defined， Notice. \n\nLandlord shall in no event be charged with default in any of its obligations hereunder unless and until Landlord shall have failed to perform such obligations within 30 days (or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default） after written notice to Landlord by Tenant， specifically describing such failure. \n\nSection 19.2.

Upon any default under this Lease by Tenant as defined in Section 18.1 hereof，any or all of Tenant's obligations to Landlord secured hereby shall，at Landlord's option，be immediately due and payable without notice or demand. Landlord's lien shall be subordinate to the lien or security interest of any vendor or lessor of equipment or chattels upon the Premises or of any lender taking or succeeding to a purchase money security interest thereon， and upon Tenant's written request， if no default exists hereunder， Landlord shall execute an instrument confirming such subordination. Landlord's interest hereby created shall survive the termination of this Lease if such termination results from Tenant's default. The above-described lien is in addition to a cumulative of the Landlord's lien provided by the laws of the State of Illinois. \n\nARTICLE XXI ACCESS BY LANDLORD \n\nSection 21.1. Right of Entry. \n\nLandlord， its agents and employees shall have the right to enter the Premises and the building thereon from time to time at reasonable times upon at least 48 hours written notice and not during Tenant's prime meal hours except in an emergency， to examine the same， show them to prospective purchasers and other persons， and make such repairs, alterations， improvements or additions as Landlord deems desirable. Rent shall not abate while any such repairs， alterations, improvements, or additions are being made. During the last 6 months of the Lease Term， Landlord may exhibit the Premises to prospective tenants and maintain upon the Premises notices deemed advisable by Landlord. In addition， during any apparent emergency， Landlord or its agents may enter the building on the Premises forcibly without liability therefor and without in any manner affecting Tenant's obligations under this Lease. Nothing herein contained， however， shall be deemed to impose upon Landlord any obligation, responsibility or liability whatsoever, for any care， maintenance or repair except as otherwise herein expressly provided. \n\nARTICLE XXII HOLDING OVER，SUCCESSORS \n\nSection 22.1. Holding Over. \n\nIf Tenant holds over or occupies the Premises beyond the Lease Term (it being agreed there shall be no such holding over or occupancy without Landlord's written consent)， Tenant shall pay Landlord for each day of such holding over a sum equal to the greater of (a) one and one-half times the Minimum Monthly Rent prorated for the number of days of such holding over， or (b) Minimum Annual Rent plus Percentage Rent prorated for the number of days of such holding over， plus,whichever of (a) or (b) is applicable，a prorata portion of all other amounts which Tenant would have been required to pay hereunder had this Lease been in effect. If Tenant holds over with or without Landlord's written consent Tenant shall occupy the Premises on a tenancy from \n\nmonth to month and all other terms and provisions of this Lease shall be applicable to such period. \n\nSection 22.2. Successors. \n\nAll rights and 1iabilities herein given to or imposed upon the respective parties hereto shall bind and inure to the several respective heirs， successors， administrators, executors and assigns of the parties and if Tenant is more than one (1） person， they shall be bound jointly and severally by this Lease except that no rights shall inure to the benefit of any assignee or subtenant of Tenant unless the assignment or sublease was approved by Landlord in writing as provided in Section 13.1 hereof. Landlord, at any time and from time to time, may make an assignment of its interest in this Lease and, in the event of such assignment， Landlord and its successors and assigns (other than the assignee of Landlord's interest in this Lease) shall be released from any and all 1iability thereafter accruing hereunder. \n\nARTICLE XXIII QUIET ENJOYMENT \n\nSection 23.1. Landlord's Covenant. \n\nIf Tenant pays the rents and other amounts herein provided, observes and performs all the covenants， terms and conditions hereof, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the Lease Term without interruption by Landlord or any person or persons, subject， nevertheless， to the terms and conditions of this Lease provided that in the event of a breach of this Section, Tenant shall fully and completely exhaust its remedies against Tenant's title insurance company prior to seeking any damages or remedies it may have against Landlord. \n\nARTICLE XXIV M",

Key data points include the transition from an annual rent of $84,000.00 for the first term (2/1/06-1/31/11) to $92,400.00 for the second term (2/1/11-1/31/16), indicating a rent increase of 10.71%, reflecting adjustments for inflation or property value increases over the five-year extension.

It is organized into three columns: 'Term', 'Annual Rent', and 'Monthly Rent'. The 'Term' column outlines the options for lease extension while the other two columns detail the corresponding rent amounts for these terms. Key points include the specifications of the lease extensions, with Option 1 having an annual rent of $101,640.00 and monthly rent of $8,470.00 for the period from February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021. Following this, Option 2 reflects an increase to $111,804.00 annually and $9,317.00 monthly from February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2026. This suggests a rent escalation strategy over time. Statistically, this indicates a projected total rent increase of approximately 11.4% over the five years. The increase in both annual and monthly rent corresponds with the trends in the region's real estate market, ensuring lease terms remain competitive and reflective of current market value. The data presented supports the surrounding content by illustrating the financial implications and expectations set in the First Amendment to Lease, specifically highlighting landlord and tenant agreements on rent adjustments and obligations.",

It is organized into two columns: 'Period' and 'Breakpoint'. The 'Period' column delineates distinct time frames during which specific financial thresholds (Breakpoint) apply for rent calculations based on gross sales. The key data points feature breakpoints increasing progressively from $4,600,000 during the initial five-year period (2/1/06-1/31/11) to $5,990,200 in the later period (2/1/21-1/31/26). This pattern indicates escalating revenue expectations as the lease progresses, reflecting potential business growth. The inclusion of options for renewal at adjusted breakpoints relates directly to the lease provisions discussed, indicating a dynamic adjustment aligned with market conditions or expected sales growth. The table thus illustrates how leasing terms can adapt over time based on business performance, reinforcing the need for flexibility in lease agreements as outlined in the surrounding content.",

The table is structured with two columns: 'Period' and 'Breakpoint,' which detail the rental conditions for specific timeframes. Key data points reveal the incremental increase in breakpoint values from $4,600,000.00 during the initial extended lease period (2006-2011) to $5,990,200.00 for the last period (2021-2026). This indicates a trend of increased profitability expectations from GMRI, Inc. over time, reflecting inflationary pressures or expectations of growth in revenue. The relationship between the Lease Amendment terms and the outlined breakpoints establishes clear financial obligations for the tenant, demonstrating how the amendment seeks to align landlord expectations with tenant performance. Understanding these breakpoints is significant as they directly impact the Tenant's financial liability concerning Percentage Rent, thus linking commercial lease arrangements to broader economic conditions. The table directly supports the surrounding content by contextualizing the numerical aspects of the lease amendment, providing essential insights into the financial framework of the agreement between GMRI, Inc. and Transportation Plaza Associates.",
