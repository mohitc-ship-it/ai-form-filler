In the event Tenant elects to terminate this Lease， rentals shall be apportioned as of the date of taking. Should Tenant elect not to terminate this Lease， Tenant shall repair, restore or rebuild Tenant's improvements as nearly as possible to the condition they were in just prior to the taking. If the portion of the Premises or improvements thereon taken by eminent domain is not material to the continued operation of Tenant's business， then no adjustment in rent shall be made and this Lease shall continue.

# Section 18.1. Right to Re-Enter.

The following shall be considered for all purposes to be defaults under and breaches of this Lease: (a) any failure of Tenant to pay any rent or other amount when due hereunder after 15 days written notice; (b) any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other of the terms, provisions， conditions and covenants of this Lease for more than 30 days after written notice of such failure; (c) a determination by Landlord that Tenant has submitted any false report required to be furnished hereunder; (d） anything done by Tenant upon or in connection with the Premises or the construction of any part thereof which after 30 days written notice and failure to cure within said 3O days,

directly or indirectly interferes in any way with, or results in a work stoppage in connection with， construction of any part of the center or any other tenant's space: (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Tenant or the filing by or against Tenant within 3O days of a petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of Tenant's property， or Tenant's assignment for the benefit of creditors; (f) if Tenant abandons or vacates or does not do business in the Premises for 10 days,or (g) this Lease or Tenant's interest herein or in the Premises or any improvements thereon or any property of Tenant are executed upon or attached after 15 days notice thereof; or (h) the Premises come into the hands of any person other than expressly permitted under this Lease. In any such event， and without grace period, demand or notice (the same being hereby waived by Tenant)， Landlord, in addition to all other rights or remedies it may have, shall have the right thereupon or at any time thereafter to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant stating the date upon which such termination shall be effective, and shall have the right,either before or after any such termination, to re-enter and take possession of the Premises， remove all persons and property from the Premises， store such property at Tenant's expense, and sell such property if necessary to satisfy any deficiency in payments by Tenant as required hereunder， all without notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming 1iable for any loss or damage occasioned thereby.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if Tenant commits any default hereunder for or precedent to which or with respect to which notice is herein required, and commits such defaults within 12 months thereafter， no notice shall thereafter be required to be given by Landlord as to or precedent to any such subsequent default during such 12 month period (as Tenant hereby waiving the same) before exercising any or all remedies available to Landlord.

# Section 18.2. Right to Relet.

If Landlord re-enters the Premises as above provided，or if it takes possession pursuant to legal proceedings or otherwise， it may either terminate this Lease or it may， from time to time，without terminating this Lease， make such alterations and repairs as it deems advisable to relet the Premises，and relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may extend beyond the Lease Term) and at such rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion deems advisable; upon each such reletting all rentals received by Landlord therefrom shall be applied, first， to any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second, to pay any costs and expenses of reletting， including brokers and attorneys' fees and costs of alterations and repairs; third， to rent due hereunder，and the residue，if any， shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as it becomes due

![](images/76fbcb0fe86f61790ac8d835b00b9f385ee1af78936ec29ec2a6d3be0e181c46.jpg)

hereunder，with a credit thereon to the extent that the aggregate rentals and other charges shall exceed the respective amount due hereunder， provided that such credit shall only be used to reduce any further rent owed by Tenant pursuant to this Section and under no circumstances shall Landlord be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any excess rental received.

If rentals received from such reletting during any month are less than that to be paid during that month by Tenant hereunder， Tenant shall immediately pay any such deficiency to Landlord. No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such termination is given by Landlord.

Notwithstanding any such reletting without termination， Landlord may at any time thereafter terminate this Lease for any prior breach or default. If Landliord terminates this Lease for any breach， or otherwise takes any action on account of Tenant's breach or default hereunder,in addition to any other remedies it may have， it may recover from Tenant all damages incurred by reason of such breach or default, including attorneys' fees，all costs of retaking the Premises and including the excess， if any，of the total rent and charges reserved in this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term over the then reasonable rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the Lease Term， all of which shall be immediately due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. In determining the rent payable by Tenant hereunder subsequent to default, the Minimum Annual Rent for each year of the unexpired portion of the Lease Term shall equal the average Minimum Annual and Percentage Rents which Tenant was obligated to pay from the commencement of the Lease Term to the time of default，or during the preceding 3 full calendar years，whichever period is shorter.

# Section 18.3. Counterclaim.

If Landlord commences any proceedings for non-payment of rent (Minimum Annual Rent， Percentage Rent or additional rent)， Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim of any nature or description in such proceedings. This shall not，however，be construed as a waiver of Tenant's right to assert such claims in a separate action brought by Tenant. The covenants to pay rent and other amounts hereunder are independent covenants and Tenant shall have no right to hold back, offset or fail to pay any such amounts for default by Landlord or any other reason whatsoever.

# Section 18.4. Waiver of Rights of Redemption.

To the extent permitted by law, Tenant waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws if Tenant is evicted or dispossessed for any cause， or if Landlord obtains

possession of the Premises due to Tenant's default hereunder or otherwise.

Section 19.1. Default Defined， Notice.

Landlord shall in no event be charged with default in any of its obligations hereunder unless and until Landlord shall have failed to perform such obligations within 30 days (or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default） after written notice to Landlord by Tenant， specifically describing such failure.

Section 19.2. Notice to First Mortgagee.

If the holder of the first mortgage covering the Premises shall have given written notice to Tenant of the address to which notices to such holder are to be sent， Tenant shall give such holder written notice simultaneously with any notice given to Landlord of any default of Landlord,and if Landlord fails to cure any default asserted in said notice within the time provided above， Tenant shall notify such holder in writing of the failure to cure, and said holder shall have the right but not the obligation， within 30 days after receipt of such second notice， to cure such default before Tenant may take any action by reason of such default.

# ARTICLE XX

Section 20.1. Taxes on Leasehold.

Tenant shall be responsible for and shall pay before delinquent all municipal， county， federal or state taxes coming due during or after the Lease Term against Tenant's interest in this Lease or against personal property of any kind owned or placed in， upon or about the Premises by Tenant.

Upon any default under this Lease by Tenant as defined in Section 18.1 hereof，any or all of Tenant's obligations to Landlord secured hereby shall，at Landlord's option，be immediately due and payable without notice or demand. Landlord's lien shall be subordinate to the lien or security interest of any vendor or lessor of equipment or chattels upon the Premises or of any lender taking or succeeding to a purchase money security interest thereon， and upon Tenant's written request， if no default exists hereunder， Landlord shall execute an instrument confirming such subordination. Landlord's interest hereby created shall survive the termination of this Lease if such termination results from Tenant's default. The above-described lien is in addition to a cumulative of the Landlord's lien provided by the laws of the State of Illinois.
